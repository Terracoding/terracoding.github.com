agile: Agile is an iterative approach to building software that allows developers to adapt to changing requirements and produce a functioning prototype quickly.
ruby on rails: Rails is a Ruby framework with a thriving developer community. It provides a solid foundation for us to build on and lets us reuse code written by fellow Rails developers to implement common features.
api: An API is a communication layer between two pieces of software, for example to let an iPhone app query a web server for data.
html5: HTML5 supports lots of cool app-like features that let us build Web applications that feel almost like native apps on mobile.
wireframes: A wireframe is a basic layout of where elements such as buttons and images will be placed in an interface. It lets us experiment with different layout options easily to see what works.
responsive: A responsive website adapts to the size of the device it is being viewed on, ensuring that it looks good and functions well for all visitors. This site is a good example! Try resizing the window or rotating your device.
test coverage: Automated testing is vital to ensure reliable software. Tests give us piece of mind that a new feature is not breaking functionality elsewhere and vastly reduce unexpected bugs.
