      <p>Sharpest tool in the shed, by Lachlan Donald</p>
      
      <p>“Distributed Team working” is a hot topic at the moment.  Great companies such as 37Signals embrace ability to work with talent spread across the globe.  The advantages are clear:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Having a better choice of talent rather than being restricted to a local talent pool.</li>
        <li>Reduced overheads</li>
        <li>Diversity</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>There is no doubt that without tech, distributed working would be difficult, making the above advantages unobtainable.  Here are 10 technologies we rely on in our day to day workflow as a distributed team (in no particular order).</p>
      
      <h2 id="trellohttpwwwtrellocom">1. <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a></h2>
      
      <p><img alt="Trello" title="Trello" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTvAbQ20erMIe-BxuTSzW5zziGQECvqXv_euCjyCoVadco5D3j7zw" /></p>
      
      <p>We love Trello, and we use it for all sort of cases.  From a simple task lists, Business Model Canvases, it’s represented in Trello boards.</p>
      
      <h2 id="sprintlyhttpwwwsprintly">2. <a href="http://www.sprint.ly">Sprintly</a></h2>
      
      <p><img alt="Sprintly" title="Sprintly" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS_tcBaLC6Exm8K8J803H-XCdnmXciIU880Bur6oZ0TdUwm1Ad9" /></p>
      
      <p>Sprintly is a beautifully designed Kanban board app.  We use it to manage our client or in-house software projects as part of our Agile development efforts.</p>
      
      <p>One of the philosophies behind Sprintly’s design is that human’s are bad at time estimation.  So the app focuses more on enhancing communication and integrating third party solutions.</p>
      
      <p>Because we love Sprintly, we developed an iPhone / iPad app for it. This makes it super easy and fast to add, and track stories: Sprintly in your pocket!</p>
      
      <p>We have also built a couple of workflow tool for Sprintly, which are available <a href="http://terracoding.com/sprintly/">here</a>.</p>
      
      <h2 id="sqwigglehttpwwwsqwigglecom">3. <a href="http://www.sqwiggle.com">Sqwiggle</a></h2>
      
      <p><img alt="Sqwiggle" title="Sprintly" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRediEZHDijK9FDBpzQfoX_GpQYl2gCZFKI5rqY_kJrBlqWWJfx" /></p>
      
      <p>Our friends at Sqwiggle have developed an awesome app that essentially gives you a sense of being in the company of your team mates, even though (in our case) we’re on opposite sides of the world.</p>
      
      <p>Sqwiggle is video / chat collaboration app.  Unlike other video apps we know of, it takes snap shots of your colleagues every few seconds so that you can get a sense of their status (almost as if you were sat next to them).</p>
      
      <p>With one click on a team mate’s snapshot you are instantly connected.  Conversations generally tend to be short on Sqwiggle (a quick query and back to work).  It feels great being able to have instant access to team mates.</p>
      
      <h2 id="facebook-groups">4. Facebook Groups</h2>
      
      <p>We tried out a number of enterprise social networking solutions.  Facebook’s private groups is a great fit for the small team that we are.  We already use Facebook socially, and the interface is clean, and responsive.</p>
      
      <h2 id="bundlllhttpwwwbundlllcom">5. <a href="http://www.bundlll.com">Bundlll</a></h2>
      
      <p>One problems we found with being a distributed team was essentially a side effect of the technology that facilitates distributed working in the first place!!</p>
      
      <p>There was a time when I used to work in the same building as everyone else.  All our required software was installed on our work desktops.  There was something called a network drive (remember those!!) which stored all our work, organised in project folders and accessible from any company office.</p>
      
      <p>The problem back then was that it was difficult to access work outside the office, especially if we needed the same software packages at home as we did at work.  In addition to that, the network was not accessible outside the office without having specialist software. Cloud apps solved this problem, but they instigated a new problem as a result:</p>
      
      <p>Now there is a plethora of cloud apps available, from spreadsheets to drawing apps to mind mapping tools.  The problem now is that by using many of these apps (which we do), the team’s work lives in the apps themselves rather than being in an organised structure (i.e. what the network drive was).  When the work is scattered across many team collaboration tools, it is difficult to get a handle on where particular pieces of work are located.</p>
      
      <p>This is what the inspiration behind Bundlll came from.  We wanted a centrally organised work reference system that we can use to find anything related to our projects; without having to rely on memory as to whether a piece of work resides in, say, Evernote or Dropbox.</p>
      
      <p>Bundlll is currently in closed beta, <a href="http://www.bundlll.com">but we would love to have you on the beta list</a> ;)</p>
      
      <h2 id="dropboxhttpwwwdropboxcom">6. <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a></h2>
      
      <p><img alt="Dropbox" title="Dropbox" src="http://blogs.evergreen.edu/seedsandcircuits/files/2013/05/Dropbox-Art.jpg" /></p>
      
      <p>Dropbox stores most of our files in our shared folder.  Everyone is in sync; a no brainer.</p>
      
      <h2 id="hipchathttpswwwhipchatcom">7. <a href="https://www.hipchat.com">HipChat</a></h2>
      
      <p><img alt="HipChat" title="Dropbox" src="http://cdn.appstorm.net/windows.appstorm.net/files/2012/05/HipChat.png" /></p>
      
      <p>A big reason for using HipChat is the ability to integrate webhooks for our Continuous Integration servers, for Errbit error reports and for activities on Sprintly.</p>
      
      <p>In other words, whenever we have a new software build, we receive a message on HipChat containing the build status (passing or failing).  Also, if an error occurs on any of our apps we get a notification in our HipChat within the project’s specific room.</p>
      
      <p>We use HipChat for general communications and we are big fans of the <a href="http://hipchat-emoticons.nyh.name/">HipChat emoji!</a></p>
      
      <h2 id="githubhttpwwwgithubcom">8. <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a></h2>
      
      <p><img alt="Github" title="Github" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Octocat,_a_Mascot_of_Github.jpg" /></p>
      
      <p>Github is vital for our distributed work.  Our Github repositories host most of our code.  We use <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen’s branching model</a> as a guide for collaborating on a codebase.</p>
      
      <h2 id="google-docs">9. Google Docs</h2>
      
      <p><img alt="Google Docs" title="Google Docs" src="http://0.jsucdn.com/instructionaltech/files/2012/02/M-GoogleDocs.jpg?75f79a" /></p>
      
      <p>One of the things we like about Google docs is being be on the same page as your team mate, quite literally! Realtime collaboration on a document is great!</p>
      
      <h2 id="evernotehttpwwwevernotecom">10. <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a></h2>
      
      <p><img alt="Evernote" title="Evernote" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/si0cgkp2rkVX5JhhBYrtZ4cy2I1hZcrx8aiz-v8MjvPykfhT7-YAM2B8MNi0OCF9AQ=w300" /></p>
      
      <p>We share a Terracoding notebook between us on Evernote.  There we store things like blog post examples, email templates, interviews and general notes.  We all use Evernote individually so why not make it the team’s note taking app.</p>
      
      <p>Do you work in a distributed team? What other apps do you use that help streamline your workflow.  We would love your feedback :)</p>
