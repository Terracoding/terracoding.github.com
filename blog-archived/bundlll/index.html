      <p>Over the past year or two working as a distributed team, we have come across many problems with keeping everyone in sync with where some documentation is, or where we’ve stored the latest wireframes for a project. It started off fine when we had just the one project, but the more projects we would get, the more our work would get scattered across different folders in Dropbox, notebooks in Evernote, and not to mention the plethora of other web applications that help us out everyday (myBalsamiq, Sprintly, Pivotal Tracker, GitHub, HipChat, Google Drive, Airbrake, etc.).</p>
      
      <p>With the recent booming market for online web applications, there has been a never-ending amount of great tools to help us with our work. But the more tools we would start using, the harder it becomes to stay up to date. We started off by trying to cut down on the number of applications we use, but as soon as we would get another client, they would have a preference over some of the tools they want us to use, or we would end up inviting them to a number of tools they probably have never heard of in their life. Documents get duplicated (pages saved as PDFs, documents copied from one Dropbox folder to another), and different files are sent across via email attachments. This is where Bundlll comes in.</p>
      
      <p><a href="/blog/bundlll/bundlll-screenshot.png"><img width="400" src="/blog/bundlll/bundlll-screenshot.png" /></a></p>
      
      <p><a href="http://bundlll.com">Visit Bundlll here</a></p>
      
      <p>Bundlll is a simple pin board to help teams keep up to date with all the different tools that are being used, or even just to post interesting URLs to sites that may be of interest. Boards can be created privately (to keep a track of your own work), or shared with the team. When a “pin” is added to one of the boards, any team member can then “repin” them into their own board structure. If there are any changes to this pin, then all the boards with the pin get updated so everyone knows when and where things have been changed.</p>
      
      <h2 id="boards">Boards</h2>
      
      <p>Boards in Bundlll have a great significance when working with distributed teams. We found the hardest thing when working with multiple tools, is to keep relating files all together in one place for a project. For example, if we’ve started a new project “Project B”, then we could create a new board in Bundlll. Within this board, we could put everything that relates to Project B in there. Early on we may put some wireframes in there for our first designs, maybe some interviews regarding customer validation, or even some documents that we need to get our payment system up and running. Later on in the project, we could add a board within the “Project B” with a link to our bugs and issues, or some documentation that another team member needs to carry on with a task or feature.</p>
      
      <h2 id="re-pinning">Re-pinning</h2>
      
      <p>We think repining of items solves a number of problems. Mainly, that when you end up joining a shared folder on Dropbox, you are then subjected to follow a specific file structure that another team mate has created, or even that others have to follow your own file structure. This can get confusing when team mates rename folders, or put a file in a “wrong” location. These files get lost and it takes longer and longer to find where the file is located that someone else has just told you has been added. Re-pinning means you no longer have to follow someone else’s file structure.</p>
      
      <h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
      
      <p>In Bundlll, we have added a feature to allow you to separate your users into different teams, this allows for boards to be shared within only a specific team. This is extremely useful for when we get a new client, we can just pop them into a new team and share boards that only relate to them in there.</p>
      
      <p>We think Bundlll is going to be a great tool for a huge amount of teams, no matter if they are programmers, designers, teachers or work in business.
