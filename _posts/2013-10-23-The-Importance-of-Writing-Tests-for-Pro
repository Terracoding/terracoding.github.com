The example goes like this:

Just as the developer thinks it will be a smooth morning, they are bombarded with error reports or bug tickets on entrance to the office; the 5 year old software is broken again!

After some time debugging, the developer concludes that the bug was caused by a change introduced a couple of days ago.  

"But why could we not prevent it from happening?"

"There were no tests!"

"Ah."

"We must increase the test coverage then!"

"We can, but it will be difficult to 'draw up the design plans for a house, when we don't even know what's between the walls and what's under the floor' "

The keyword in focus here is design plans.

It is often found in many organisations that there is a disconnect in communication between the technical team and the business development team (team names being generic here).  This disconnect often means that the technical team does not have visibility into why feature decisions are made and how the effectiveness of new features play out in the market.

On the other hand, the business development team does not have enough visibility into what a feature change or a feature addition requires.  Sometimes, the victim of this disconnect becomes: communicating the importance of  automated testing as an integral part of a project.

Developers often strive to communicate the importance of automated testing.  It is debatable if testing adds time to feature completion.  However, what we have witnessed, time and time again, is that a good test suite certainly results in huge savings when it comes to changing a product, new product phases, product redesigns and general ongoing maintenance work.

But because savings in developer costs during the actual building of a feature often cannot be demonstrated to a product owner, testing is less appreciated during the early phases of software building.

Therefore, the lack of a good test suite often disguises itself as a hidden cost.  A cost that doesn't bite till later.  The role of a developer is to emphasis to a product owner the importance of testing, mainly for the wellbeing of the product.

At Terracoding we cannot emphasise automated tests enough.  We illustrate it's importance using this analogy:

A software product that lacks adequate automated tests is like building a skyscraper without design plans.  

In construction (where I first started out).  Constructing a structure from design plans is a given; it is standard everyday work.  You would not get approval otherwise.  Without design plans, you would not know what to build and in what sequence.  

Nevertheless, the argument against this analogy would be: in software we build from a product spec, which is synonymous to design plans for a building.  

That is correct.  

However, design plans are also used by engineers to carry out maintenance work.  Generally in Software there are more occurrences of maintenance work than there are in construction; and what TDD offers is a way to automatically make sure that a product still works to the spec when a change is made.  The alternative is expensive human resources who manually test the product.

If the luxury of automation in maintenance was available in construction, a lot of money would be saved.  In fact there are efforts in construction to use 3D simulation technologies to make use of automation leading to cost savings.

Some of the naming conventions used by developers to describe techniques for testing and designing software include Test Driven Development, Test First Development and Behavioural Driven Development.  There are differences between these techniques, and choices are made subjectively.

However, no matter what methodology your developer chooses, the take away here is the importance of a good test suite as a primary expectation when commissioning developers.

Have you witnessed the monetary savings a good test suite has given your project or organisation?  We would love your comments :)
