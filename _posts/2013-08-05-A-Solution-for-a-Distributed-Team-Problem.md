Terracoding consists of 4 developers, 2 of which work in Sheffield, 1 works in Doncaster and 1 in Sydney.  We have clients distributed in Sydney and the US.  Working as distributed team, as such, would have been quite difficult a decade ago, but thanks to awesome collaboration tools out there, it is now feasible.

Because we are remote working, we rely on a lot of tools to collaborate:  Github, Sprintly, Invision, Trello, email, Evernote, Google docs, Dropboxâ€¦.

These tools produce so many updates / notifications and there are some many touch points for people to communicate.

This introduces more opportunities for people to miss out on important pieces of communication.  Often we find debates taking place between team members or clients simply because a piece of information (be it a customer interview, or a feature plan) is known to one team member, whist another team member has missed out on it.


**We previously tried solving this problem in two ways:**

We tried consolidating the tools we use (e.g. why use Dropbox and Google drive, just use one).  But this presents another problem: people's preferences.

People want to use a certain tool over the other, because they also use it elsewhere (at work, personal stuff).  If as a team we decide to ditch one of two competing tool, chances are those who were not in favour will stop using the chosen tool.

We also utilised group chat (campfire as an example). This is where we have hooks to push data like errors notifiacations / Sprintly cards.  These notifications are posted to the relevant chat rooms.  That works well to a certain extent until we try to find something that someone had said a couple of days back.

**The solution we are working on:**


Yes, it's a another piece of technology to solve a problem created by technology!

When we asked our selves, why do team members and clients keep missing on the communication touch points embedded on all these tools we use, the apparent answer was that people simply ignored many of their notifications, be it email notifications, desktop notifications or push notifications.

As an effect of the plethora of tools we use, we receive a tonne of app email notifications. App email notifications are very useful.  Without some form of notification system, we would have to remember to go back and check the apps we use.

However, we found that email wasn't the best tool to digest app notifications.  We found that colleagues or clients would often ignore many of the notifications coming in, or filter them out.

Whilst many of these notifications aren't important in the grand scheme of things, missing an error report from a tool such as Errbit or a mention from a colleague in a agile management tool such as Sprintly can slow progress down and compromise the quality of our work.

So we decided that notifications should be consumed outside of email or smart phones, and that a place should exist purely to consume notifications.

We also decided that a good way to decide if a notification is important is when a "the team" thinks it's important.  So we decided to build a way for a team to consume notifications as a collective.

This is what we have been working on. It's called [Arrivals] (http://www.arrivals-app.com).If you're interested signup and we'll be happy to speak to you :)

Do you also get notification overload when using many collaboration apps?  Do you have a process in place to manage it all? We would love to know your thoughts below.
