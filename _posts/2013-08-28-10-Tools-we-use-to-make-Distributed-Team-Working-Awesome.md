"Distributed Team working" is a hot topic at the moment.  Great companies such as 37Signals embrace ability to work with talent spread across the globe.  The advantages are clear:

* Having a better choice of talent rather than being restricted to a local talent pool.
* Reduced overheads
* Diversity

There is no doubt that without tech, distributed working would be difficult, making the above advantages unobtainable.  Here are 10 technologies we rely on in our day to day workflow as a distributed team (in no particular order).

**1. [Trello](http://www.trello.com)**

We love Trello, and we use it for all sort of cases.  From a simple task lists, Business Model Canvases, it's represented in Trello boards.

***2. [Sprintly](http://www.sprint.ly).***

Sprintly is a beautifully designed Kanaban board app.  We use it to manage our client or in-house software projects as part of our Agile development efforts.

One of the philosophies behind Sprintly's design is that human's are bad at time estimation.  So the app focuses on enhancing communication and integrating third party solutions, as oppose to focusing on story estimations.

Because we love Sprintly, we developed an iPhone / iPad app for it. This makes it super easy and fast to add, and track stories: Sprintly in your pocket!

We have also built a couple of workflow tool for Sprinty, which are available here.

***3. [Sqwiggle](http://www.sqwiggle.com)***

Our friends at Sqwiggle have developed an awesome app that essentially gives you a sense of being in the company of your team mates, even though (in our case) we're on opposite sides of the world.

Sqwiggle is video / chat collaboration app.  Unlike other video apps we know of, it takes snap shots of your colleagues every few seconds appearing on your screen so that you can get a sense of their status (almost as if you were set next to them).

With one click on a team mate's snapshot you are instantly connected.  Conversations generally tend to be short on Sqwiggle (a quick query and back to work).  It feels great being able to have instant access to team mates.

***4. Facebook Groups***  

We tried out a number of enterprise social networking solutions.  Facebook's private groups is a great fit for the small team that we are.  We already use Facebook socially, and the interface is clean, and responsive.

***5. [Bundlll](http://www.bundlll.com)***  

One problem we found with being a distributed team was a side effect of the technology that facilitates distributed working in the first place!!

There was a time when I used to work in the same building as everyone else.  All our required software was installed on our work desktops.  There was something called a network drive (remember those!!) which stored all our work organised in project folders and accessible from any company office.

The problem back then was it was difficult to access work outside the office, especially if we needed the same software packages at home as we did at work.  In addition to that, the network were not accessible outside the office without having specialist software. Cloud apps solved this problem, but they instigated a new problem as a result of that:

Now there is a plethora of cloud apps, from spreadsheets to drawing apps to mind mapping apps.  The problem now is that by using many of these apps (which we do), the team's work lives in the apps themselves rather than being in an organised structure (i.e. what the network drive was).  When the work is scattered across many team collaboration tools, it is difficult to get a handle on where particular pieces of work could be located.

This is what the inspiration from Bundll came from.  We wanted a central organised work reference system that we can use to find anything related to our projects; without having to rely on memory as to whether a piece of work resides either in Evernote or Dropbox for example.

Bundlll is currenlty in closed beta, [but we would love to have you on the beta list](http://www.bundlll.com) ;)

***6. [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com)***  

![Dropbox](http://blogs.evergreen.edu/seedsandcircuits/files/2013/05/Dropbox-Art.jpg "Dropbox")

Dropbox stores most of our files in our shared foler.  Everyone is in sync; a no brainer.

***7. [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com)***  

![Hipchat](http://cdn.appstorm.net/windows.appstorm.net/files/2012/05/HipChat.png "Dropbox")

A big reason for using Hipchat is the ability to integrate webhooks for our Continuous Integration server, for Errbit error reports and for activities on Sprintly.

In other words, whenever we have a new software build, we receive a message on hip chat containing the build status (passing or failing).  Also, if an error occurs on any of our apps we get a notification in our Hipchat in the within the project's specific room.

We use Hipchat for general communications and we are big fans of the Hipchat emojies!

***8. [Github](http://www.github.com)***  

![Github](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/651575553/twittergithub2.png "Github")

Github is vital for our distributed work.  Our Github repositories host most of our code.  We use the Gitflow framework as a guide for collaborating on a codebase.

***9. Google Docs***  

![Google Docs](http://0.jsucdn.com/instructionaltech/files/2012/02/M-GoogleDocs.jpg?75f79a "Google Docs")

One of the things we like about Google docs is being be on the same page as your team mate, quite literally! Realtime collaboration on a docuemnt is great!

***10. [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com)***  

![Evernote](https://lh3.ggpht.com/si0cgkp2rkVX5JhhBYrtZ4cy2I1hZcrx8aiz-v8MjvPykfhT7-YAM2B8MNi0OCF9AQ=w300 "Evernote")

We share a Terracoding notebook between us on Evernote.  There we store thigns like blog post examples, email templates, interviews and genral notes.  We all use Evernote individually so why not make it the team's note taking app.

Do you work in a distributed team? What other apps do you use that help streamline your workflow.  We would love your feedback :)
