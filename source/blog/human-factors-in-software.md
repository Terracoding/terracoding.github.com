![Human Factors in Software, Ash Donaldson](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4151/5119935194_b55ff0391d.jpg "Ash Donaldson")

Eight o'clock on a Friday spring morning at a Darling Harbour cafe, Sydney. The smell of coffee in the air, pen and paper were all ready for an interview with Ash Donaldson, one of Sydney's most profound Behavioural / User Experience Designers, and a [TEDx speaker](http://tedxcanberra.org/talks/ash-donaldson-cognitive-dissonance/).

I first met Ash during my time at CommunityEngine, a Sydney Northern Beaches startup.  When he joined, the word on the the street was that we had struck gold with his hire.  A few months later, upon a seating reshuffle, I found myself sitting at the desk behind Ash.  Since then we became buddies!

I wanted to find out a little more about the importance of UX / Behavioural Design when building software.  Here are 10 questions and answers from our chat:

##1. Tells us a little about yourself, your professional passion and how you got into it!
**Ash:** Years and years ago I was in aviation.  The way aviation training worked is that you'd go to a commercial pilot school, and they will talk about how many pilots they've got in the airlines and how its a wonderful life...... and you're so starstruck and bedazzled by it!  Every young boy wants to be a pilot....... “And its going to cost you X amount of dollars“!

So you scrimp and save and you pay the whole thing upfront, and about the time you clear your private license, you realise that there are a lot of old pilots hanging around; there's just no jobs in the airlines. 5000 jobs in the airlines, 100,000 pilots around, you do the math!

And the best way to get around that is to become a flight instructor and tell people how wonderful it is to be in the aviation industry!!

I became a flight instructor, and I really enjoyed doing that actually; I love teaching people.  When you are teaching you have to dig deeper to be able to answer questions; this is how I become aware of Human Factors.  For example, understanding that during times of high cognitive load, extreme levels of attention is required.  Therefore, the cockpit door is locked during takeoff and landing.  Or understanding that despite what your instrument panel may be telling you, your brain will make you think you are upright!

##2. What is Human Factors Engineering?

**Ash:** Our brain is a wonderful ecosystem that strives to stay in equilibrium. This influences our behaviour. When relaxed, we have a greater propensity for creativity, but miss details. When stressed, our attention zooms in to notice the smallest detail, but we find it difficult to think outside the square.

Specific groups of people come pre-loaded with culture: jargon, background knowledge, and mental models of how the world works. For example, an artist and electrician may both use the word 'potential' but it will evoke different types of memories and understanding. This is why it makes a lot more sense to design systems that accommodate how we actually behave rather than how "a group of engineers think we behave."

Human Factors Engineering is about understanding how people behave in certain circumstances, and designing the work around these responses.  Human factors is a multi-disciplinary science synonymous with ergonomics.  Historically, this discipline was used to design tools in mission critical situations, where people would die if you didn't design things that would fit humans, but everything else around us wasn't designed to fit humans.   I was listening to an interesting podcast recently where businesses were changing the way they created content based on the Content Management System (CMS), instead of having tools that worked around the way they made content!

I always espouse the behaviour formula of Kurt Lewin, the Father of Social Psychology: Behaviour is a function of a person and their environment. If the person or environment changes, this changes their behaviour. For example, if a person becomes very hungry, they have a short attention span. They become impatient and quick to anger - which may be very different from their usually thoughtful, placid demeanour. Conversely, if you were to change an environment somebody works in all day, like a CMS, it will also affect their behaviour. Change a workflow, and users will find a way to hack around it.

This is the fun behind human factors, you need to design a system based on people's current behaviours whilst understanding their motivations, because you know that as soon as you introduce this tool, their behaviour is going to change.  So you need to understand what causes the behaviours in the first place, in order to shape the tool in the right direction.

##3. Walk us through a typical user research exercise you would undertake for a new project.

**Ash:** The typical workflow for a user research exercise would be:

Know what the client wants. Most of the time they don't know!  For example, a client would say "we need an iPad app", and when you ask them "why?", the response: "because we need it...." So you start by asking them to state what the business needs are and who the target population is:

"I am going to do something for someone and this is going to be the result.". 

This is one of the hardest things for the business to identify.

Form a hypothesis - "I need to grow sales in this area, therefore I think that we will need to do x,y,z…"

Now we have a hypothesis about the market, we have to go out and study that market and find out what it is that is stopping that market doing the desired outcome.  This is where BJ Fogg's work comes into play. He and his colleagues at Stanford developed a simple model of behaviour. For a behaviour to occur, it requires a motivation, ability and trigger. Motivation and ability can be in tension with each other. If the person has a low motivation, the behaviour may still occur if the ability is high enough, and vice-versa. You can model this and understand what's stopping the behaviour. Then you can explore ways in which to increase the motivation or ability, to increase the likelihood of the behaviour.

So you can say "they're not doing x because of y", and then you have to go back to what their original motivations and needs are.  You then say maybe that is not what we should be doing, maybe that is not the solution here. You can start experimenting with what you think could be a solution.

A lot of people think that research is a big undertaking, but the amount of guerrilla research I have done going to cafés and saying I'll buy you a coffee if I can sit down with you for 5 mins.... It's well worth it.

##4. What is ISO 25062:2006? Any other standards worth mentioning?

**Ash:** This is the Common Industry Format for Usability Testing.  It is applied at the highest stage of fidelity - where a product is at maturity and you are going through iterations to continually make it better. Many software companies end up 'breaking' their software because they keep adding features, but never test to make sure that these iterations are actually making things better.

This is a scientifically replicable experiment that anyone can re-perform.

There is also a framework for research that has been in place since the 1940s which is an international standard, that no one seems to know about, which is [ISO 9241-210:2010](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=52075),
Ergonomics of Human-System Interaction -- Part 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems.

##5. What's the difference between the ISO 25062:2006 format and, say, testing a prototype with users, for a startup product?

**Ash:** People get confused about usability testing, they tend to think that it is all done in a lab, in a fake environment performing a series of made up tests.  This is called Summative Usability Testing. Which is a far cry from formative testing, which is what I described earlier - where you sit down with someone in a cafe. 

Summative is where you have already been through the differing levels of fidelity, and now you want to know the response as a result of adding a new variable.  You already have all the metrics, e.g. time on task, and average error rate.  You have all the metrics for that piece of software, for a specific test.  Now you are going to add one more feature into the picture and see how it affects everything.

For example, you did all the above at the end of the development lifecycle last year, you did a summative test and you set a baseline and you got your baseline metrics for everything....  This year, you are going to add 15 new features and you are going to implement them one at a time.

For each one, you are going to do a summative test to see whether it makes things better or worse.  Because you have specified exactly the type of person who is going to be doing this type of testing and you have a controlled replicated environment, you can compare any changes to the baseline.  Generally it is people with mature products that do this. 

The standard tells you what sorts of things you should be recording, and what metrics you should be gathering.  It puts them into this common industry scientific format report that you can give to an external agency and say this is how we tested this, now go test these new iterations using the same method. 

Whereas formative testing is 99% of usability testing, and people get it confused. They think of usability testing as one type.  Formative usability testing is best done in context. So you go to peoples' work place and you do a cognitive walkthrough, to start with, then you do some paper prototyping, then you do some light mock ups. You go through those iterations but it is best to do it in context so that you can see how the environment impacts upon their behaviour in completing a task.

##6. Here at Terracoding, we work with greenfield projects and startups.  In terms of product development, what advice would you give to startup folks at the start of a product development cycle?

**Ash:** Take your idea and objectively put it in front of people. Put a few drawings of the flow on paper and have a few screens for people to see. 

I liken it to a ship going across the ocean. A few degrees off course at the beginning may be unnoticeable at first, but by the end of the journey can equate to 100s of miles from the target destination.  As I alluded to earlier, people confuse summative and formative usability testing and see it as this big expensive, hard to set up thing. This is why it's always left to the end. 

Whereas, if you have defined who it is you are building this for in the first place, one of the first things you do is find out where they are. They are going to be on certain forums or groups, in certain areas in a café.... Find out where they are and go and hang out in those types of places. For the price of a coffee, or nothing at all, it is amazing how grateful people are when you ask them about a piece of software they think is being developed for them!


##7. What resources would you recommend for those embarking on building a new user centric software?

**Ash:** [Steve Krug](http://www.sensible.com/) wrote 2 really digestible books. One is 'Don't Make Me Think' which covers the basics of making usable software. The second is "Rocket Surgery Made Easy", which mis-spells the myths about usability testing. These books give you the really practical stuff. 

One more book, [Jodie Moule](http://www.symplicit.com.au/) [- "Killer UX"](http://www.sitepoint.com/books/ux1/), a book on UX mainly for developers, it goes through the process with developers in mind, covering the different techniques and the detail.


##8. So are these resources useful for those startups, particularly if they can't hire a UX designer yet?

**Ash:** There shouldn't be anything such as a "UX designer", as UX belongs to everyone!  And that's why human factors is one of those weird things!  Human factors engineers are actually facilitators.  When you are actually doing the study you learn about these different disciplines and it is only so that you can communicate them and have an appreciation of where they come from. 

You concentrate mostly on the psychology, you've got to know a bit about industrial design... this that and the other so that you can draw it all together.  You then say we are going to apply x,y disciplines, and draw on x,y principles to solve this problem. 

So the role of the UX designer is to see the bigger picture and have that vision to get everyone to give their specialist opinions on it.  After you gather all of that, then the UX designer puts together the prototype and goes out to get validation. They then go back and say "Ok, that didn't work because this, this and this…"

It's crazy.... people think of roles as specific people!  But in a startup, you have one person doing the front-end, back-end and marketing.  Someone else does the business plan, architecture and the packaging!  So you've got six roles there already, perfect!


##9. When starting out, why is it important to take a "step back" and research, before coding or even wireframing?

**Ash:** If you actually spend some time doing the research then you can design something that is actually useful to someone.  For example, I am designing something for accountants, here are several different types of accountants and X is a common behaviour across all of them.... here is what their motivations are... So I am going to have the core of the software just coming off those motivations. 

Then there is going to be small hidden stuff that cover off these other things that they have to do.  Then I look at what the most efficient, or the best accountants are doing so we design the tool for them and supporting their type of process.... This is going to shape what the not so good accountants in doing things better! 

When anything that you put into an environment is going to shape their behaviour,  you may as well make them better at what they are doing. 

The quick and cheapest way of doing something like this is to do a cognitive walkthrough.  After you have observed people and observed how they do things, you come up with a hypothesis on how it should be done better.  Scribble on a piece of paper, talk to them, and ask them to point to where they would go whilst talking through what it is.  It takes 5 mins to do and you get validated learning! The problem is, people tend to skip that step and go straight to the coding. This can be a very costly exercise.

I use caution when using the term 'Wire Frames' because these turned from a simple communication tool (a simple sketch) that you put down in front of someone, to these beautiful documents that have to be done in Omnigraph or Visio! They have become a product in themselves! 

Balsamic is one of the best prototyping tools as it allows replication.  Polished wirerames can create a biased response, if it looks professional people don't want to hurt your feelings; it can create interviewee/interviewer bias!

Testing with users goes through fidelity levels. The first level is to draw a sketch with pen and paper or talk to people.  A marked up and more detailed copy of those original sketches or wireframes would be the second level.  The third level would be to do it up in Omnigraph or whatever, because you are going from gross problems that need to changed wildly, to the details, to "ok we are on the right track", to "now we just need to tweak the wording", to "now we are going to look at how the aesthetics affect it".

When its ugly there is the tendency to blame the software for why it doesn't work.  However, when it's pretty people blame themselves for why it doesn't work, so it doesn’t have a massive effect on the end product.

##10. In an ideal organisation setup, how would you see: Marketing, Engineering and UX all fitting together?
  
**Ash:** In the ideal situation all the teams can get together!!  One of the failings of some companies, and it's a bit of a fad at the moment, is the work space allowing for flexible working (open space with no desk allocation).  But what is more important is having a [war room](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/16212/how-to-set-up-a-war-room). That makes it easy to keep up to date concepts, flows and designs on the walls, where anyone can quickly be brought up to speed on the project and where it's up to.  As things change, with blue tac, team members create new versions and capture those changes to show why the changes were made.

Look up [Harriett Wakelam](https://twitter.com/hwakelam) - [she just gave a talk at Next Bank Asia](http://vimeo.com/48870927).  She has created the perfect environment over at NAB where you have everything from the C level execs making the strategic business decisions,  to the architects, to the frontend devs all providing on projects; all having a clear vision of the what the project is so everyone knows what and who we are trying to solve for. 

The specialists, and the strategists with the KPIs, all have this vision and understanding.  Any talk about design should define the user, what their goal is and how are we going to solve it. It should never be about, 'I don't like that', 'I don't think that will work'.  And by-the-way, the word "user" in that context should be banned!  Because the "user" is everything to everyone and the perception of the user keeps changing.

That is why you have personas, perhaps give them names.  There should only be one persona to start with, sometimes you can have secondary personas.  Don't try to solve for another persona until you have solved for the first.
