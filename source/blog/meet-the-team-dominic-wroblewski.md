Dominic is Technical Director here at Terracoding. Born in Redditch, a small town just south of Birmingham, he made Sheffield his home when he decided to study Computer Science at the [University of Sheffield][uos]. A strong advocate of almost all things tech-related, he discovered his passion for programming whilst at secondary school, developing some of the first apps for iOS shortly after Apple unveiled the App Store. When he's not running the [Sheffield Swift][ss] meetup, he's busy setting world records on [Guild Wars 2][gw2], or scuba diving in seas both hot and cold.
