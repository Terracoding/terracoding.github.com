Dominic is Technical Director here at Terracoding. Born in Redditch, a small town just south of Birmingham, he made Sheffield his home when he decided to study Computer Science at the University of Sheffield. A strong advocate of almost all things tech-related, he discovered his passion for programming whilst at Secondary school, developing some of the first Apps for iOS shortly after Apple released the App Store. When he's not running the Sheffield Swift meetup, he's busy setting world records on Guild Wars 2, or Scuba Diving seas both hot and cold.
