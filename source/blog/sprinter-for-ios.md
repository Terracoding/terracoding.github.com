Recently I have been working closely with the Sprint.ly team to work on the development of our new app for iOS, named "Sprinter".

Sprinter is an iOS app that enables the user to access all their projects and items that are held on the Sprint.ly website. It works very similar to a Kanban board. Behind the scenes we have been testing the app with a number of close friends of Terracoding to try out our latest new product.

Over the past few days I have been packaging up the app ready for the public! Although not yet fully ready for release, we are making a few last minute fixes and getting the final testing ready for a proper release early November.

We have decided to first release the iPhone version of the app as we would love to hear peoples thoughts on the app before we release a new version alongside the iPad release.

In the mean time, you can check out the [product page](http://terracoding.com/sprintly/index.html) that contains a few pre-release screenshots.

If you have any further questions regarding the app, or would like to share your thoughts on the release, feel free to [email us](/contact/).
