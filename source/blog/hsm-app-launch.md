We're excited to announce that [the app we've been working on with Hello Sunday Morning][case] was released last week! On top of that, Apple was kind enough to feature it as App of the Week in Australia.

The app suggests challenges you can do as an alterantive to drinking and provides useful stats on how your health is improving as a result.

You can leave comments and tips on your favourite challenges, share what you are doing on your profile and check in each week with how things have been going.

We're really proud of how it turned out and hope that it will help thousands of people improve their relationship with alcohol!
