        :kramdown
          The creators of [Postsnap][ps], a popular iPhone app for sending personalised cards, approached us with a similar idea for flowers.

          They wanted to start completely fresh, utilising our expertise in modern #{define('iOS')} development to create a beautiful app for customising and buying bouquets.

          We jumped at the chance! [Postabloom][pb] is now available on the UK App Store for download.

          While the customer app is clean and simple, there is a lot more to Postabloom behind-the-scenes. We worked closely with the team to build a robust, fully-fledged product management system that lets them keep up with orders even on Valentines day.

          Our web-driven back-end receives orders from the app, automatically generating barcodes and PDF templates for Postabloom's various fulfilment companies.

          On the factory floor, printing a postage label is as simple as scanning a barcode.

          The Latest Mobile Technology
        :kramdown
          With an in-house developer and an app already in the Store, Postsnap knew what goes in to building a good iPhone app. The team didn't just want to expand on what they had though, they wanted Postabloom to be a best-in-class app for shopping on #{define('iOS')}.

          To make sure the app lasted for years to come, we built it in [Swift][], Apple's new language designed for faster, more stable apps. The interface is also scalable to cover the increasing variety of devices Apple offers.

          We look forward to bringing Postabloom to the iPad soon!
