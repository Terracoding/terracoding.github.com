          Mobile Applications
        :kramdown
          We've been building for iOS since 2007 and love helping businesses embrace the mobile revolution. We'll work with you to craft your idea into an app you can be proud of. Need a Web component too? We'll build an #{define("API")} so your app and website talk to each other. And, if you want to go cross-platform, our #{define("HTML5")} mobile apps feel at home on any device.

          Design
        :kramdown
          Design isn't just making things look pretty. We'll help you transform your idea into a functioning product through #{define("wireframes")}, interface mockups and live demos. We know what makes a good user experience but you lead the way, guiding us towards your vision with regular iterations. #{define("Responsive")} site or native mobile app, it will look and feel great.

          Training
        :kramdown
          A good hand-over is vital but often overlooked. Our projects often transition to an internal team on completion. We write clear, extendable code and enjoy educating fellow developers so the software we build for you flourishes for years to come. We also offer consultancy to help your business embrace new technology and best practices.
